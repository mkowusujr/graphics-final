# Graphics Final
For this project, created a small scene using the techniques and skills we have learned in the past weeks. 

The scene we created is of a barren tree on a floating island. We constructed the floating island with a hemisphere on the bottom, with procedurally generated roots extending from the hemisphere. The roots were generated by randomly selecting triangles on the bottom of the hemisphere to extrude, which will go out in random directions. On the top of the hemisphere, we procedurally generated a cylinder, representing the trunk of a tree. We used the same process for generating roots to create branches on the tree trunk.


## How to Run the Project
This project makes use of javascript modules and as a result, won't work by just running the `index.html` file. One workaround to get this project running is to set up and use a web server. 

We recommend running this in VSCode using the Microsoft Live Preview extension. Below are the instructions for running this project with this extension:

1. Using the command palette (`ctrl` + `shift` + `p`), enter the `startup server` command
2. This will open the live preview to the right of your screen, which should be rendering our scene.a
